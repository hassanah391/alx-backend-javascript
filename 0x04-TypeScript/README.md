- **Task 1**: More complex interfaces with optional properties and function interfaces
- **Task 2**: Advanced types with function overloads and type guards
- **Task 3**: Ambient declarations and namespace imports
- **Task 4**: Namespaces and class extensions
- **Task 5**: Advanced type features including branded types
